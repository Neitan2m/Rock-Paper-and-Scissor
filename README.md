# Rock-Paper-and-Scissor
It's a simple Rock, Paper and Scissor
In this prohect a use the basics of javascript, css and html 

In this project i learned how to put conditionals properly in a function. Making the entire page more interactive was so interesting
Maybe in a fell days i will come back to turn the game more beautiful, it was a excelent experience
